# My Topic Google Doodle

Y2K tech is all about the nostalgic vibe of the early 2000s, when everyone was both excited and a little nervous about the new and uprising technology. Itâ€™s tied to that slick, shiny aesthetic such as chrome, flip phones, and bubbly fonts. I want to incorporate elements of pop culture from that time as well like cheetah print, pink, pop culture references, and how they integrated with the early 2000s.
